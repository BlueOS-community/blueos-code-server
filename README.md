# BlueOS Code Server

BlueOS extension for OpenVSCode Server.

OpenVSCode server is a project where it provides a version of VS Code that runs a server on a remote machine and allows access through a modern web browser. It's based on the very same architecture used by Gitpod or GitHub Codespaces at scale.
